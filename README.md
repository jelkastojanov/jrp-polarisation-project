## Actual and perceived polarisation in peopleâ€™s opinion on behavioural policy interventions

This repository stores R code for the analyses associated with this project: https://jrp.pscholars.org/actual-and-perceived-polarisation-in-peoples-opinions-on-behavioural-interventions/

Across different countries and samples, this project examines how different communication strategies affect people's support for behavioural policy interventions, and their tendency to (mis)perceive polarisation in this domain.

This repository includes:

  1. Analysis of pilot data (Pilots 1 & 2) [Completed]
  2. Analysis of data from the two main studies (Studies 1 & 2) [Data collection ongoing]
