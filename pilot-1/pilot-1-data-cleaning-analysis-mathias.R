DATA ANALYSIS

########

TASK 1: All 7 of us should go through the policy goals included in Pilot 1 (SLO/UK) and categorise them as economic/social in different pages of the Excel sheet.


TASK 2 (Analysis steps):
  
  1. Categorise people based on political affiliation
1a. Average economic and social views and classify those over 50 as conservative, those below 50 as liberal
1b. Use economic and social views separately for economic and social goals (Same classification logic)
1c. Use the approach from Zmigrod et al. (2018) - Scores for each political party can be found in the Supplementary materials. Some political parties might not have scores so look for alternative YouGov data.

2. Calculate actual disagreement between conservative and liberal participants - For this part, exclude strict moderates (those who scored 50).
3. Calculate perceived disagreement between conservative and liberal participants (first calculate the difference scores within each participant and then average them) - Strict moderates should be included at first, but when we are doing the comparison between liberal and conservative samples, they should be exluded again (since they don't strictly fall into any of the political categories).

```{r}
cor.test(politicalIdeologyFinal$economiclViews, politicalIdeologyFinal$socialViews) # How correlated are economic and social views?

# Approach 1a
politicalIdeologyFinal$averageIdeology <- (politicalIdeologyFinal$economiclViews + politicalIdeologyFinal$socialViews) / 2

# Create a histogram
politicalIdeologyFinal %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = averageIdeology)) +
  geom_histogram()

# How many people scored 50 on different political ideology variables?
politicalIdeologyFinal %>%
  dplyr::filter(averageIdeology == 50)

politicalIdeologyFinal %>%
  dplyr::filter(economiclViews == 50)

politicalIdeologyFinal %>%
  dplyr::filter(socialViews == 50)

# Classification based on average scores
politicalIdeologyFinal$politicalAffiliationGroup <- 
  if_else(politicalIdeologyFinal$averageIdeology > 50, 'Conservative', 
  if_else(politicalIdeologyFinal$averageIdeology < 50, 'Liberal', 'Moderate'))

# Classification based on economic views
